Project Overview:

To-Do List Application with Local Storage

Project Objective:

The To-Do List Application with Local Storage project is a web-based application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks. The application uses local storage to persist tasks between sessions.The application will be built using HTMl,CSS,and JavaScript, and will Utilize local Storage for data persistence.

Project Goals:

- Create a user-friendly interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, and reminder times for each todo task
- Utilize local storage for data persistence
- Provide a basic and intuitive user experience

Project Requirements:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Local Storage
- Modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

Project Features:

- User can create new todo tasks with reminder times
- User can view existing todo tasks
- User can update existing todo tasks
- User can delete existing  todo tasks
- Reminder times are displayed for each todo task
- Local storage is used for data persistence

Project Structure:

- index.html: The main HTML file for the application
- styles.css: The CSS file for styling the application
- script.js: The JavaScript file for implementing the application's functionality
- localStorage: Used for data persistence

Project Implementation:

1. Create Task: When the user clicks the "Add Task" button, a new task is created and added to the task list.
2. Read Task: When the user loads the application, the task list is populated with tasks from local storage.
3. Update Task: When the user clicks the "Edit" button for a task, the task is updated with the new text.
4. Delete Task: When the user clicks the "Delete" button for a task, the task is removed from the task list and local storage.

Local Storage Implementation:

- Tasks are stored in local storage using the "localStorage.setItem()" method.
- Tasks are retrieved from local storage using the "localStorage.getItem()" method.
- Tasks are updated in local storage by updating the task list and then saving the updated list to local storage.

Testing and Debugging:

- Test the application by creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Verify that tasks are persisted in local storage between sessions.
- Debug any issues that arise during testing.

Project Deliverables:

- A fully functional To-Do List Application with Local Storage
- A documented codebase (using comments and README files)
- A brief presentation outlining the project's features and functionality
